# My Personal Data Science Notebook
Sharing my personal data science notebooks.

# What for?
* This should allow you to quickly stand up a Jupyter Notebook in your local environment.
* Your notebooks should be copy & pasted inside the notebooks folder, if you want to play with them.
* All newly created notebooks should also be available in the /notebooks folder.

# How to Get Started
1. Simply run `docker-compose up --build`
2. In the console, you should see the token available for logging in to the notebook. Use that to log in. See example below:
```
http://localhost:8888/?token=374a0750701273a1faa027f0b39ef5874f210d663284d2aa
```
3. Create or play around with the available notebooks! Have fun!
